#[github](https://github.com/)
####difference among *master*, *HEAD* and *origin* 
* *master*: The name of the default branch that git creates for you when first creating a repo. In most cases, "master" means "the main branch". Most shops have everyone pushing to master, and master is considered the definitive view of the repo. But it's also common for release branches to be made off of master for releasing. Your local repo has its own master branch, that almost always follows the master of a remote repo.
* *HEAD*: The current commit your repo is on. Most of the time HEAD points to the latest commit in your branch, but that doesn't have to be the case. HEAD really just means "what is my repo currently pointing at". means not the lastest version, but the current version.
* *origin*: A name commonly given to the main remote. remote is another repository that you can pull from and push to. Usually it's on some server, like github.
